# 🎭 Ticket Booking System – Java Console App

Final project for the first term of my software development program.  
Developed using Java and object-oriented programming principles.

## 📚 Description

This is a console-based application that simulates a simple theater ticket reservation system. The user can:

- View available seats
- Select and reserve seats
- Cancel reservations
- View total sales

The system tracks seat availability and updates the seating chart in real-time.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 17)
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## ✅ Features

- Seating map display with available and reserved seats
- Input validation for seat selection
- Pricing logic by row and seat category
- Sales and reservation summaries
- Menu-driven interface for easy navigation

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

This project was part of a graded assessment during my first semester.  
It focused on:

- Applying OOP principles such as encapsulation and abstraction
- Designing user interaction through a command-line interface
- Building logic-driven programs with clear input/output flows
